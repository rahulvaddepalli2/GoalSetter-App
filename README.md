# GoalSetter-App
<h3>What does this application do?</h3>
Application allows users to set &amp; track goals

<h3>What did building this teach me?</h3>
This project taught me how to implement the MERN Stack:

- Express.js (Server framework)
- MongoDB (Flexible Document Database)
- React (JS library to build UI)
- Node (JS runtime environment)

This application uses middleware to:
1. Protect routes (using JWTâ€”authentication token)
2. Handle errors.

In the frontend, we use Redux for global state management (creating slices for authorization & goals)
